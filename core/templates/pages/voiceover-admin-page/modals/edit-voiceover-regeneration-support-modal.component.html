      <strong>⏳ coming soon: </strong>This action will cause voiceovers to be regenerated for all existing
      <strong>{{languageDescription}}</strong>
      translations in each curated exploration.

      <i>
        <strong>Note: </strong>If there are 100 explorations, each with 10,000 characters in its
        <strong>{{languageDescription}}</strong> translation, the estimated cost for regenerating all voiceovers is approximately
        <strong>$16 USD.</strong>

      If you change your mind and turn on autogeneration again to "Yes" in near
      future, all voiceovers for this language accent code in all the curated
      explorations will be regenerated from scratch, as translations may have
      changed. This will incur additional costs as per the given “Note” below.

      The language code (<strong>{{languageCode}}</strong>) is not defined with
      the necessary data in the <strong><a [href]="constantsFileLocation">constants file</a></strong> for the following fields:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>LANGUAGE_CODE_TO_MATH_SYMBOL_PRONUNCIATIONS</strong></li>
      <li><strong>LANGUAGE_CODE_TO_SENTENCE_ENDING_PUNCTUATION_MARKS</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These fields are essential for accurately synthesizing voiceovers for math symbols and ensuring correct sentence highlighting
      during automatic voiceover playback.

      <strong>Note: </strong>Please consult with the development team and add it to the codebase before proceeding with this action.
