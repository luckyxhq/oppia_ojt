"""Validation Jobs for base models

# How to write validation jobs:

For every group of data models defined within 'core/storage/<X>/gae_models.py',
there should be a corresponding validation job file named 'X_jobs.py' located
within the `datastore_audit` directory. This file should contain a validation
job for each of the models defined in the corresponding `gae_models.py`.

The naming convention for the validation job classes within 'x_jobs.py'
should be `<StorageModelName>ValidationJob`.

This class must implement the following methods:

- `get_validation_fns(self):
  This method should return a list of functions. Each function takes a model
  instance as input and yields `JobRunResult` objects for any validation
  errors found.

- `get_validate_domain_object_fn(self):
  This method should return a function that takes a model instance and
  validates its corresponding domain object. It should yield
  `JobRunResult` objects for any validation errors found in the domain object.
