"""Entry point for accessing the full collection of Apache Beam jobs.

This module imports all of the "jobs.*_jobs" modules so that they can be fetched
from the JobMetaclass which keeps track of them all.

TODO(#11475): Add lint checks that ensure all "jobs.*_jobs" modules are imported
into this file.

# IMPORTANT: These modules MUST be imported! DO NOT DELETE!
# We need each module to execute so that the class definitions trigger the
# metaclass logic. That is, the following code:
#
#     class FooJob(base_jobs.JobBase):
#         pass
#
# Will execute the following code:
#
#     JobMetaclass.__new__('FooJob', (base_jobs.JobBase,), {})
#
# We need this to happen for every job in this registry file, because the
# registry depends on JobMetaclass to handle the responsibility of keeping track
# of every job.
